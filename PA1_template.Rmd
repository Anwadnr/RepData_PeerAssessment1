# LOADING and PREPROCESSING THE DATA 

## Set Directory and Load Libraries
```{r} 
setwd("H:/Projects/RepResProj1")

library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(data.table)
library(lattice)
library(tidyr)
```

## 1. Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
###  Data download
```{r}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"

download.file(fileUrl, destfile = 
  paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'))

unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",exdir = "data")
```

### Reading in CSV
```{r}
activity <- read.csv("data/activity.csv")
```

# WHAT is MEAN TOTAL NUMBER  of STEPS TAKEN PER DAY?

## 1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day 
```{r}
Total_Daily_Steps <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)
```

## 2. HISTOGRAM of the total number of steps taken per day 
### Histograms show distributions of variables. Bar charts compare variables.
```{r}
hist(Total_Daily_Steps, xlab = "Number of Steps", 
  main = "Steps per Day")
```

## 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the toal number of steps taken per day 
```{r}
Mean_Per_Day <- mean(Total_Daily_Steps, na.rm = TRUE)
Median_Per_Day <- median(Total_Daily_Steps, na.rm = TRUE)

print(Mean_Per_Day)
print(Median_Per_Day)
```

# WHAT is the AVERAGE DAILY ACTIVITY PATTERN?

## 1. Time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5 min interval (x) and average number of steps taken, avergaed accross all days (y)
```{r}
Steps_Interval <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(as.numeric(names(Steps_Interval)), 
     Steps_Interval, xlab = "Interval", 
     ylab = "Steps", main = "Activity Pattern Daily Average ", 
     type = "l")
```

## 2. Which 5 min interval, on average across all the days in the datatset, contains the maximum number of steps? 
```{r}
Interval_Max <- names(sort(Steps_Interval, decreasing = TRUE)[1])
Steps_Max <- sort(Steps_Interval, decreasing = TRUE)[1]
```

# INPUTING MISSING VALUES

## 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
```{r}
Missing_Values<- sum(is.na(activity$steps))

print(Missing_Values)
```

## 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 

### Replace NAs with the mean number of steps for interval

## 3. Create new dataset equal to the original dataset with missing data filled in 
```{r}
Steps_Interval <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Split by interval
```{r}
Activity_Split <- split(activity, activity$interval)
```

### Fill NAs
```{r}
for(i in 1:length(Activity_Split)){
  Activity_Split[[i]]$steps[is.na(Activity_Split[[i]]$steps)] <- Steps_Interval[i]
}
Activity_Input <- do.call("rbind", Activity_Split)
Activity_Input <- Activity_Input[order(Activity_Input$date) ,]
```

## 4. Make histogram of total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps. Differing values? impact? 
```{r}
Total_Daily_Inputed <- 
  tapply(Activity_Input$steps, Activity_Input$date, sum)

hist(Total_Daily_Inputed, xlab = "Number of Steps", main = "Histogram: Steps per Day (inputed data)")

Mean_Day_Input <- mean(Total_Daily_Inputed, na.rm = TRUE)
Median_Day_Input <- median(Total_Daily_Inputed, na.rm = TRUE)

print(Mean_Day_Input)
print(Median_Day_Input)
```

# ARE THERE DIFFERENCES in ACTIVITY PATTERNS BETWEEN WEEKDAYS AND WEEKENDS?

## 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" 
```{r}
Activity_Input$day <- 
  ifelse(weekdays(as.Date(Activity_Input$date)) 
  == "Saturday" | weekdays(as.Date(Activity_Input$date)) 
  == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")
```

## 2. Make panel plot containing time series plot (type "l") od 5 min interval (x) and the average number of steps taken, averaged. 

### Average steps for weekends
```{r}
Steps_Interval.weekend <- 
  tapply(Activity_Input[Activity_Input$day
  == "weekend" ,]$steps, Activity_Input[Activity_Input$day 
  == "weekend" ,]$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Average steps for weekdays
```{r}
Steps_Interval.weekday <- 
  tapply(Activity_Input[Activity_Input$day 
  == "weekday" ,]$steps, Activity_Input[Activity_Input$day 
  == "weekday" ,]$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Create 2 panel plot
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
```

### Weekday activity
```{r}
plot(as.numeric(names(Steps_Interval.weekday)), 
     Steps_Interval.weekday, xlab = "Interval", 
     ylab = "Steps", main = "Weekday Activity", 
     type = "l")
```

### Weekend activity
```{r}
plot(as.numeric(names(Steps_Interval.weekend)), 
     Steps_Interval.weekend, xlab = "Interval", 
     ylab = "Steps", main = "Weekend Activity", 
     type = "l")
```
